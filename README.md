- Created the project.
- I've decided to try out the "Projects" feature Github provides to organize tasks
- Decided some game design stuffs and where should I start coding.

- Create project, folder structures, asmdefs
- I've added the asmdefs first to ensure all dependencies will be respect from the beginning
- Add the first interface and domain to create a behavior test
- With the test up and working, all domains will have tests as part of its creation.
